## Linux Directory Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/home` | Home directory for users |
| `/etc` | System configuration files |
| `/var` | Variable data such as logs |
| `/tmp` | Temporary files |
| `/usr` | Installed applications and binaries |
| `/root` | Home directory for the root user |

## Commands

### Navigation

```bash
pwd
ls
ls -la
cd
cd ~
cd ..
```

### File Management

```bash
mkdir
touch
cp
mv
rm
find
```

### Disk Usage

```

## Absolute Path vs Relative Path

### Absolute Path

Starts from the root directory.

Example

```bash
/home/raafindra/week1/documents
```

### Relative Path

Starts from the current working directory.

Example

```bash
week1/documents
```
